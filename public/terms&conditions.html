				This Agreement was last revised on April 28, 2021.
			</p>
			<p class="terms-main__item">
				Welcome to Goodreads.com, the website and online service of Goodreads LLC (together with its affiliates, "Goodreads" "we," or "us"). This page explains the terms by which you may use our service. By accessing or using the Goodreads services, website and software provided through or in connection with the service ("Service"), you agree on behalf of yourself and all members of your household and others who use this Service under your account ("you" or "your") to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement, the Goodreads Privacy Policy, the Amazon.com Conditions of Use, and the other applicable rules, policies and terms posted on the Goodreads.com website or provided with the Service (collectively, this "Agreement"), whether or not you are a registered user of our Service.
			</p>
			<p class="terms-main__item">
				We reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any time in our sole discretion by posting the revised Agreement on the Goodreads.com website. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Agreement. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").
			</p>
			<h2 class="terms-main__subtitle">
				1. Use of Our Service
			</h2>
			<p class="terms-main__item">
				You do not have to register in order to visit Goodreads. To access certain features of the Service, though, including creating "bookshelves" to organize what you've read, posting book reviews, and commenting on other members' reviews, you will need to register with Goodreads and create a "Member" account. Your account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.
			</p>
			<p class="terms-main__item">
				You may never use another Member’s account without permission. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your account, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to notify Goodreads immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
			</p>
			<p class="terms-main__item">
				Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and your payment of any applicable fees, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and make personal and non-commercial use of the Service. This license does not include any resale or commercial use of any part of the Service, or its contents; any collection and use of any book listings, descriptions, reviews or other material included in the Service; any derivative use of any part of the Service or its contents; any downloading, copying, or other use of account information for the benefit of any third party; or any use of data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools. All rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved and retained by us or our licensors, suppliers, publishers, rightsholders, or other content providers. No part of the Service may be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without our express written consent. You may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout, or form) of Goodreads without our express written consent. You may not use any meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing our name or trademarks without our express written consent. You may not misuse the Service. You may use the Service only as permitted by law. The licenses granted by us terminate if you do not comply with this Agreement.

			<h2 class="terms-main__subtitle">
				2. User Content
			</h2>
			<p class="terms-main__item">
				Some areas of the Service may allow Users to upload, publish, display, link to or otherwise make available (hereinafter, "post") reviews, comments, questions, highlights, and other information including Users’ names, voices and likenesses ("User Content"). You are solely responsible for your User Content. You agree not to post User Content that is illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of content. You hereby represent that you are the owner of all the copyright rights with respect to, or that you have the legal right to post, your User Content, and that you have the power to grant the license granted below. Goodreads reserves the right to monitor, reject and/or remove any User Content at any time. For example, Goodreads may, but is not obligated to, reject and/or remove any User Content that Goodreads believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions.
			</p>
			<h2 class="terms-main__subtitle">
				3. License Grant
			</h2>
			<p class="terms-main__item">
				By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant to Goodreads a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify Goodreads for all claims resulting from content you supply. If you submit User Content via the “My Writing” or “Ebook” features, our Terms of Use for Writers apply to that User Content.
			</p>
			<h2 class="terms-main__subtitle">
